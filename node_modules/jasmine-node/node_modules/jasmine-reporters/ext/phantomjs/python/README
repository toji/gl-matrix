ADDITIONAL INFO
----------------
This program is a port of PhantomJS to Python/PyQt4 (thus, PyPhantomJS).
  1) We try to make PyPhantomJS to be as compatible with PhantomJS as possible,
     this means having the exact same features as they do. It happens to be fully
     compatible, with the exception of some very small things.
  2) PyPhantomJS however, has a few differences as well:
     * Some of the features work a little differently than PhantomJS.
       In most of these cases, the features were only changed to improve their
       reliability and performance, so they work more often/better, and break less.
     * There may also be additional features present that aren't in PhantomJS.

PhantomJS was written by Ariya Hidayat, and I'd like to give him a BIG thanks
for all his work on PhantomJS! :)
